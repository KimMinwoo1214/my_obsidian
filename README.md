# My Study Record With Obsidian
I first heard about Obsidian and ignored it because I was using Notion more at the time. So, I kept using Notion. However, Obsidian's Graph view caught my attention, and that's why I decided to start using Obsidian.

From 2024.07.11, I started using Obsidian. Now I introduce my study record.
