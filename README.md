# My Study Record With Obsidian
I first heard about Obsidian and ignored it because I was using Notion more at the time. So, I kept using Notion. However, Obsidian's Graph view caught my attention, and that's why I decided to start using Obsidian.

From 2024.07.11, I started using Obsidian. Now I introduce my study record.

### Side project - AGV car with Robot Arm
#### [Side Project](https://github.com/KimMinwoo1214/my_obsidian/tree/main/50.Projects)
This project primarily focuses on developing a prototype. For the main project, our team plans to build an AGV car with a robot arm. 
<br/>
We will be using Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega to accomplish this. The link above directs to our project repository.
