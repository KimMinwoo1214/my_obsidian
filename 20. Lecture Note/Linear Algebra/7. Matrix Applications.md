1. **Multivariate Data [[Covariance]] Matrices:**
    
    - **Correlation Coefficient**: Calculated as the vector dot product between two data variables divided by the product of their norms.
    - **Covariance**: Measures how two variables change together, not bound by ±1 like the correlation coefficient.
    - **Covariance Matrix**: Symmetric matrix that includes variances along the diagonal and covariances off-diagonal. Computed by organizing data into a matrix and using matrix multiplication.
    - **Properties**: Covariance matrices are always features-by-features and symmetric.
2. **[[Geometric Transformations]] via Matrix-Vector Multiplication:**
    
    - **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: Used to apply geometric transformations to coordinates.
    - **Rotation Matrix**: Orthogonal matrix used to rotate vectors while preserving their lengths.
    - **Transformation Matrix**: Used to rotate, stretch, or shrink points in a coordinate system.
    - **Interactive Figures**: Implementation in MATLAB to visualize transformations like rotation.
3. **[[Image]] Feature Detection:**
    
    - **Image Filtering**: Extends time series filtering to 2D images by using convolution.
    - **2D Gaussian Kernel**: Used for smoothing images; defined by a mathematical formula involving an exponential function.
    - **Convolution Operation**: Element-wise multiplication followed by summation, applied over an image using a kernel to produce filtered images.
    - **Feature Detection Kernels**: Specific kernels can be designed to detect features like horizontal and vertical lines.
