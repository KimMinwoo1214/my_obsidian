# 강의필기 (Lecture Notes)

- **[[Correlation]] and [[Cosine Similarity]]**:
    
    - **Correlation Coefficient**: Quantifies the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1.
        - **+1**: Perfect positive relationship.
        - **-1**: Perfect negative relationship.
        - **0**: No relationship.
    - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in the dot product space.
        - **Range**: [-1, +1]
        - **0°**: Cosine value is 1 (completely identical vectors).
        - **180°**: Cosine value is -1 (completely opposite vectors).
        
- **Time Series [[Filtering]] and [[Feature Detection]]**:
    
    - **Mechanism of Filtering**: Compute the dot product between the kernel and the time series signal.
    - **Convolution**: Compute the dot product between the kernel and overlapping signal segments to produce filtered signal points.
    
- **[[K-means Clustering]]**:
    
    - **Algorithm**:
        1. Initialize k centroids as random points.
        2. Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and centroid.
        3. Assign each data observation to the group with the closest centroid.
        4. Update each centroid as the average of all data observations assigned to it.
        5. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or for a specified number of iterations.

**Exercises**:

1. **Correlation and Cosine Similarity**:
    
    - Write a MATLAB function to compute the Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity between two vectors.
    - Create a variable `var1` containing integers 0-3, and compute the Pearson correlation and cosine similarity between `var1` and an offset variable `var2` in a loop.
2. **Time Series Filtering and Feature Detection**:
    
    - Build an edge detector using a kernel for an edge detector.
    - Write code to create a plateau function signal and compute the dot product between the kernel and segments of the time series data.
3. **K-means Clustering**:
    
    - Implement the K-means clustering algorithm in MATLAB.
    - Write code to initialize k centroids, compute Euclidean distances, assign data to clusters, and recompute centroids in a loop.
    - Rerun the K-means code several times to observe cluster assignment consistency.
