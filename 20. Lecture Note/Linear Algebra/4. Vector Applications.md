- **[[Correlation]] and [[Cosine Similarity]]**:
    
    - **Correlation Coefficient**: Quantifies the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1.
        - **+1**: Perfect positive relationship.
        - **-1**: Perfect negative relationship.
        - **0**: No relationship.
	    - **Formula for Pearson correlation coefficient**:
	    $$
		\rho = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
		$$

		$$
		\rho = \frac{\mathbf{x}^T \mathbf{y}}{\|\mathbf{x}\| \|\mathbf{y}\|}
		$$

    - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in the dot product space.
	     $$
		\cos(\theta_x,y) = \frac{\alpha}{||x||\text{ }||y||}\quad \text{Formula for cosine similarity}
		$$
        - **Range**: [-1, +1]
        - **0°**: Cosine value is 1 (completely identical vectors).
        - **180°**: Cosine value is -1 (completely opposite vectors).
        - **in 0° ~ 180°**: cosine value is less than 1.
    - **==Pearson correlation== and ==Cosine similarity== represent the linear ==relationship== between two variables.
	    - **They can give different results for the same data.**
			- **example)**
			$$
			\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \begin{bmatrix} 100 & 101 & 102 & 103 \end{bmatrix}
			$$
			- Pearson correlated: 1 and Cosine similarity: 0.808
        
- **Time Series [[Filtering]] and [[Feature Detection]]**:
    
    - **Mechanism of Filtering**: Compute the dot product between the kernel and the time series signal.
    - **Convolution**: Compute the dot product between the kernel and overlapping signal segments to produce filtered signal points.
    
- **[[K-means Clustering]]**:
    
    - **Algorithm**:
        1. Initialize k centroids as random points.
		    $$
		    \mathbf{k} \text{ is a parameter of } \mathbf{k}-\text{means clustering.}
		    $$
        1. Compute the Euclidean distance between each observation and centroid.
	        $$
	        \delta_{i,j} = \sqrt{(d_i^x - c_j^x)^2 + (d_i^y - c_j^y)^2}
	        $$
	        $$
	        \delta_{i,j}: \text{ The distance from data observation i to centroid j}
	        $$
	        $$
	        d_i^x: \text{ The feature x of the } \mathbf{i_th}\text{ data observation}
	        $$
	        $$
	        c_j^x: \text{The x-axis coordinate of centroid } \mathbf{j}
	        $$
        1. Assign each data observation to the group with the closest centroid.
		- Distance and squared distance are monotonically related, so both give the same answer.
		- Adding the square root operation increases code complexity and computation time.
        1. Update each centroid as the average of all data observations assigned to it.
	        - The means of all data points within the group are new centroids.
        1. Repeat steps 2-4 until convergence or for a specified number of iterations.
