- **[[Matrix]] [[Multiplication]]:**
    
    - **Composition of Transformations**: Applying one transformation followed by another can be represented as a single matrix multiplication.
    - **Examples**: Demonstrated with rotation and shear matrices.
- **Determinant:**
    
    - **Definition**: A scalar value that can be computed from the elements of a square matrix.
    - **Properties**: Important for understanding scaling effects of transformations, and a matrix with a determinant of zero is singular.
    - **Applications**: Used in finding the inverse of a matrix and solving linear systems.
- **Matrix Spaces:**
    
    - **Column Space**: The set of all possible linear combinations of the matrix's column vectors.
    - **Row Space**: The set of all possible linear combinations of the matrix's row vectors.
    - **Null Space**: The set of all vectors that, when multiplied by the matrix, result in the zero vector.
- **Inverse Matrix:**
    
    - **Definition**: A matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, yields the identity matrix.
    - **Conditions**: Only square matrices with a non-zero determinant have an inverse.
    - **Applications**: Used to solve linear systems and in transformations.
- **Rank:**
    
    - **Definition**: The maximum number of linearly independent column vectors in the matrix.
    - **Properties**: Determines the dimensionality of the column space and row space.
    - **Applications**: Important for solving linear systems, understanding matrix dimensions, and in data science applications.
- **Rank Applications:**
    
    - **Augmenting Matrices**: Used to determine if a vector is in the column space of a matrix by comparing the ranks of the original and augmented matrices.
    - **Linear Independence**: A set of vectors is linearly independent if the rank of the matrix formed by these vectors is equal to the number of vectors.
    - **Shifted Matrices**: Adding a multiple of the identity matrix to increase the rank and ensure invertibility.
- **Matrix Norms:**
    
    - **Definition**: Measures that provide a single number characterizing the size or length of a matrix.
    - **Types**: Include Frobenius norm (L2 norm), which is the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements.
    - **Applications**: Used in various fields, including machine learning and statistics, for regularization and measuring distances between matrices.
