- **The Matrix Inverse**:
    
    - **Definition**: The matrix inverse of A is denoted as A−1 such that AA−1= I
    - **Usage**: Used to solve linear systems of equations Ax=b
- **Types of Inverses and Conditions for Invertibility**:
    
    - **Full Inverse**: For square matrices that are full-rank.
    - **One-Sided Inverse**: For non-square matrices (left-inverse for tall matrices, right-inverse for wide matrices).
    - **Pseudoinverse**: For all matrices, including reduced-rank matrices, often referred to as the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse.
- **Computing the Inverse**:
    
    - **2x2 Matrix Inversion**: Swap diagonal elements, negate off-diagonal elements, divide by the determinant.
    - **Example**: A=

    - **MATLAB Implementation**: Use the `inv()` function to compute the inverse and verify it by multiplying the original matrix with its inverse to get the identity matrix.
- **The Inverse is Unique**:
    
    - **Proof by Negation**: If B and C are both inverses of A, then B=C\mathbf{B} = \mathbf{C}B=C.
- **Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse**:
    
    - **Definition**: The best pseudoinverse that can be applied to any matrix.
    - **Computation**: Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In MATLAB, the `pinv()` function computes the pseudoinverse.
- **Numerical Stability of the Inverse**:
    
    - **Challenges**: Inverting large matrices can lead to numerical inaccuracies due to floating-point operations.
    - **Condition Number**: Ratio of the largest to smallest singular value, indicating the numerical stability.
    - **Hilbert Matrix**: An example of a numerically unstable matrix.
- **Geometric Interpretation of the Inverse**:
    
    - **Transformation**: The inverse undoes the geometric transformation imposed by the original matrix.
    - **Example**: If T\mathbf{T}T is a transformation matrix, then U=T−1Q\mathbf{U} = \mathbf{T}^{-1} \mathbf{Q}U=T−1Q recovers the original coordinates P\mathbf{P}P.
