- **[[Vector]]**:
    
    - **Definition**: Representations of numbers or symbols in a one-dimensional array.
    - **Notation**: Bold lowercase letters (e.g., **v**), italicized (v), or with an arrow above (ùêØ).
    - **Characteristics**: Include dimensionality and orientation (column or row).
    $$
    x = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 \\
    4 \\
    5 \\
    6 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \text{, } y = \begin{bmatrix}
    .3 \\
    -7 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \text{, } z = \begin{bmatrix}
    1 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
    $$
    \text{x is a 4-dimensional column vector}
    $$
    $$
    \text{y is a 2-dimensional column vector}
    $$
    $$
    \text{z is a 4-dimensional row vector}
    $$
    - **Transpose**: Convert row vector to column vector or vice versa, effectively flipping its orientation
	$$
	\begin{bmatrix}
	x_1 \\
	x_2 \\
	... \\
	x_n \\
	\end{bmatrix} ^ T
	= \begin{bmatrix}
	x_1 & x_2 & ... & x_n \\
	\end{bmatrix} \text{Transpose o}
	$$
- **[[Vector Operations]]**:
    
    - **Addition and Subtraction**: Possible between vectors of the same dimension.
    - **Scalar-Vector Multiplication**: Scaling the vector without changing its direction.
    - **Vector Norms**:
        - **Manhattan Norm (L1 Norm)**: Sum of the absolute values of vector components.
        - **Euclidean Norm (L2 Norm)**: Square root of the sum of the squares of vector components.
- **[[Dot Product]]**:
    
    - **Definition**: A scalar product or inner product calculated by multiplying corresponding elements of two vectors and summing them up.
    - **Properties**: Measures similarity or mapping between two vectors.
    - **Geometric Interpretation**: Relates to the angle between vectors, with specific cases for acute, right, and obtuse angles.
- **[[Cross Product]]**:
    
    - **Definition**: The vector cross product in ‚Ñù3 space results in a vector orthogonal to the two input vectors.
    - **Properties**: Includes distributive, anti-commutative, and scalar multiplication rules.
- **[[Hadamard Product]]**:
    
    - **Definition**: Element-wise multiplication of two vectors or matrices of the same dimension.
    - **Notation**: Denoted by ‚äô.
- **[[Orthogonal]] [[Vector]] [[Decomposition]]**:
    
    - **Concept**: Decomposing a vector into components parallel and orthogonal to a reference vector.
    - **Applications**: Relevant in the Gram-Schmidt process and QR decomposition.

### Exercises:
1. Create visualizations for vectors and their operations using Matlab.
2. Implement functions to calculate vector norms, dot products, and perform vector decomposition.

## Ï†ïÎ¶¨ (Summary)
[[Matlab]]
- **[[Summary]] of Key Points**:
    
    - **Vector Arithmetic**: Operations are performed element-wise.
    - **Dot Product**: Encodes the relationship between two vectors as a single number.
    - **Orthogonality**: Two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is zero.
    - **Decomposition**: Involves dividing a vector into parallel and orthogonal components with respect to a reference vector.
